This code is a program that helps you keep track of your finances. It allows you to enter the income and expenses for each month and then calculate the net 
income (income minus expenses) for each month. It stores all this information in a data structure called a LinkedHashMap, which is a type of map 
(a collection of key-value pairs) in Java. The key is the month and the value is an array that holds the income, expenses and net income for that month.

The program prompts you to enter the month, income and expenses until you decide to stop by entering 'q' as month. After that it displays all the data in a tabular format showing the month, income, expenses and net income for each month.

It's a simple program that can be useful for keeping track of your finances over time. It could be improved by adding more features such as error handling, 
input validation, and ways to save and load data.
